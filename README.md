# Objects for 3D Printing

I've been learning
3D modeling
in [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/)
to create functional objects
to print.
Here are the source files
for my models.

I've provided images
that correspond to most of the models to show
a sample view of each.

## CustomizableKnob.scad

This is a slight remix
of a script
that creates parameterized knobs.
My fix is to round off the edge
of the dial,
so it's not so sharp.

## badge\_gripper/

This is an experiment
to produce a $0.29 friction clip
in 10+ hours
of design work.
It includes a soft TPU core
to form the friction grabber
and a harder PLA shell
which keeps rigid pressure.
I figure it's a functional base
for other, fancier clips,
like a Lego clip.

## cup\_hanger.scad

Add a handle on a ring
to a travel mug or other tapered cup.

## dart\_bandolier.scad

A holder for foam darts suitable to sew
to a strap for a bandolier.

## dock\_adapter.scad

Adapt a plain car mount for a phone
into a dock that holds the USB cable as well.
It slips onto the little peg feet
at the bottom
that support the phone,
and provides a fitted hole
in the middle
which holds the USB cable
in position to receive the phone.

## doorstop.scad

A little ramp doorstop for on carpet.

## fiesta_hatch_cover_hinge.scad

A quick hinge piece for the cover in the hatch
of the Ford Fiesta.

## film\_card\_holder.scad

Carry your SD cards
in a flim canister.
This insert fits
in the canister
and has slots for cards on top.
There's a peg underneath
onto which a spring can be attached
to allow the insert to eject a bit
when the canister is opened.

## ping\_pong\_net\_system.scad

We took a cheap $5 mini ping pong game
and improved it by replacing
the sticks on suction cups
with a tensioning system to clamp
the net to the table.

## space\_invaders/

Here's an early project
to take an existing set
of space invader figures
and generate velcro-like
pins on each figure,
so they stick to cloth walls
of a cubicle.
The velcro code is likely reusable
for other applications.

## wok\_lid\_handle.scad

A simple, tapered handle
to screw onto the lid
of my wok.
